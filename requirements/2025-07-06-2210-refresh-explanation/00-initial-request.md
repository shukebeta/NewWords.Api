# Initial Request

**Timestamp:** 2025-07-06 22:10
**Feature:** Add /vocabulary/refreshExplanation method

## User Request
I would love to add a /vocabulary/refreshExplanation method to allow a user to refresh the current wordexplanations record, we should first check the current word's ProviderModelName, if it is the same as current first agent in our agent list, do nothing, if it is different, use the new agent to regenerate the explanation and update the explanation record

## Key Requirements Identified
1. New endpoint: `/vocabulary/refreshExplanation`
2. Check current word's ProviderModelName vs first agent in agent list
3. If different: regenerate explanation with new agent and update record
4. If same: do nothing (no-op)
5. Focus on updating existing WordExplanations records
