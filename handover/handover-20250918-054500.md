## CURRENT TASK plus a very brief background
Working on Redis-based configuration management system for dynamic AI model config updates. Context: NewWords.Api had 85s→10s performance improvement by fixing duplicate AI calls, now need dynamic config management to replace manual Redis edits.

## COMPLETED
- [x] Fixed duplicate AI calls in VocabularyService (85s→10s performance gain)
- [x] Added detailed performance logging with Seq integration  
- [x] Cleaned up noisy logs, kept essential business metrics
- [x] Added model failure tracking logs for config optimization
- [x] Created comprehensive Redis Config Manager project plan
- [x] Evaluated Node.js vs .NET Core with decision matrix
- [x] Designed incremental implementation strategy (3 phases)

## TODO
- [ ] Phase 1: Implement Pub/Sub config subscription in NewWords.Api (2 days)
- [ ] Test manual config updates via AnotherRedisDesktopManager
- [ ] Phase 2: Build minimal web management interface (1 week)
- [ ] Phase 3: Electron desktop app with auth (2-3 weeks)

## FILES CHANGED
- `src/NewWords.Api/Controllers/VocabularyController.cs`: Added performance logging
- `src/NewWords.Api/Services/VocabularyService.cs`: Fixed duplicate AI calls, added timing logs, cleaned up noise
- `src/LLM/Services/LanguageService.cs`: Added model failure tracking, cleaned timing logs
- `src/NewWords.Api/NLog.config`: Fixed configsetting syntax for Seq logging
- `plans/redis_config_manager_plan.md`: Complete project plan with architecture, phases, decision matrix

## NEXT ACTIONS
1. Start Phase 1: Add ConfigurationSubscriber background service to NewWords.Api
2. Implement Redis Pub/Sub listener for config:* channels
3. Test config reload mechanism with manual Redis edits
4. Verify Seq logging shows config update notifications

## BLOCKERS/NOTES
- No blockers, clear incremental path forward
- Pub/Sub pattern chosen over polling for real-time updates
- Electron desktop app preferred for final version (NPM distribution advantage)
- Three-layer caching strategy inspired by Medium article on multi-tenant config management
